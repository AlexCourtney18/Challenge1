# Horiseon Refactor

## Purpose of the Assignment
We were contacted by Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc to review the code for their website. We were asked to comb through the code and make sure all links were functioning properly and the code was optimized for accessibility and screen readers. In addition we were asked to streamline the code to ensure the index and style sheets followed the correct order and organization. Lastly, we reviewed the CSS code to simplify the styling rules and consolidate any excessive rules.

## Changes Made
